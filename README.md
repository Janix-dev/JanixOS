Janix, an OS kernel with GNU GPL3, and that is open-source
---------------------------------------------------

(1) Foreword
Janix is basically based on i386(ia32, or x86-32) archictecture and a unix distribution.
And You can compile from source, distribute with kernel's codes(in 'src' directory), or download bootable image file.
This is made by a korean student, Yumin Jang.And This is just a hobby.
So, please don't be mad or angry with the codes' problems.
